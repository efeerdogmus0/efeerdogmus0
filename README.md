## 🚀 Experience & Ventures

### **Co-Founder @ Kavram.ai**
*Early Stage Venture*
Developing AI systems for robotics education. *(Major updates coming very soon!)*

### **Co-Founder @ 460 Teknoloji**
Bootstrapped a company producing drone motors and electronic cards, funded entirely by revenue from my previous venture, 460 Elektrik. This achievement led to my acceptance into **BTM (Bilgiyi Ticarileştirme Merkezi)**, one of Europe's largest startup acceleration centers, at age 16. I am also a member of the **Amazon Startup Program**.

### **Founder @ 460 Elektrik**
Built an AI-powered sales system for electronics components. The success of this system provided the capital to launch my hardware manufacturing business.

### **Intern @ RulesUp**
Integrated digital education strategies as an intern at this digital education initiative.

### **Voluntary Intern @ CoPrint**
7-month internship at a 3D printer technology company, gaining hands-on industry experience.

### **Freelance Developer**
Started freelancing at age 12, delivering software solutions for **2 major holdings** and various clients for ~2 years.

## 🛠️ The "Garage to Lab" Journey

My passion for hardware started in 7th grade when I built my first **3D printer** by forking an open-source model. By 8th grade, I was designing my own printers from scratch, capable of printing high-performance materials like PEEK.

In high school, I joined an independent **FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)** team as a founding member and lead.
- **The Beginning**: We spent two years working out of a **10m² warehouse**, pushing our limits with minimal resources but struggling to finish our robots on time.
- **The Turning Point**: Meeting a teacher from **ODTÜ GVO (ODTÜ Development Foundation Schools)** changed everything. We gained access to proper machinery and workshops.
- **The Result**: In our very first year with proper facilities, we became **Regional Winners**. We have filled our cabinet with National Championships, and now we are laser-focused on becoming **World Champions** this year! 🚀
